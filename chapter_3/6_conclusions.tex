\section{Conclusions}

This chapter explored the decomposition of infrared luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies and AGN using CIGALE. We reviewed the methodology for disentangling their contributions and presented the resulting luminosity functions, highlighting their evolution across cosmic time. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of SED decomposition in accurately constraining galaxy and AGN evolution. These findings contribute to understanding the interplay between star formation and AGN activity. \Cref{Sec: Concluding Chapter} places the results of the decomposed LF in context with galaxy evolution and AGN co-evolution.
