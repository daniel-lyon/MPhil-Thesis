\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to extend my thanks and acknowledge all the people who helped me achieve my dream of studying Astrophysics.

Firstly, to my supervisor Michael Cowley, who was always there to help me. Michael, you were always there for me (and the research group) when I needed help and you always pushed me to be my best. Without you and your support, I would not have survived in research. Truly you're a fantastic teacher and I wish you could be my supervisor forever. I know everyone in the research group holds similar sentiments. I hope my future supervisors are as kind, caring, and thoughtful as you are. I will miss bantering with you. Are you old enough to retire yet?  

To the other MPhil students in the research group, Jess, Breanna, Vanessa, and David. Even though there was a general trend of slacking-off with an increasing number of us in the office, you all kept me sane. We had a lot of fun times together and created memories I will never forget and cherish forever. Thanks for entertaining my terrible jokes and for the banter. So long suckers.

To my twin brother, Luke, who put up with living with me for all of undergrad and masters. I couldn't have done it without you brother. Thanks for being there and taking care of things when I was busy with studies. I can't imagine my life without you and it'll be unimaginably difficult when I move away. Don't miss me too much.
