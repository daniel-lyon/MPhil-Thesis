I want to thank all the people who helped me achieve my dream of studying Astrophysics.

\noindent Firstly, to my Principal Supervisor, Dr Michael Cowley. You're a fantastic teacher and leader who always pushed me to be my best. I wish you could be my supervisor forever. I hope my future supervisors are as kind and thoughtful as you are. I also thank my Associate Supervisor, Professor Nunzio Motta, for his help.

\noindent To my fellow MPhil students and the QUT Astrophysics Group --- thank you for keeping me sane throughout this journey. Even though productivity often correlated with fewer of us in the office, we created unforgettable memories. I appreciate you all for indulging my terrible jokes and for all the laughter.

\noindent To the School of Chemistry and Physics, the Faculty of Science, the Graduate Research Centre, and the College of Excellence for providing me with support. I am particularly thankful to Jennifer Grossi, Jennifer MacLeod, Wendy Laver, Jill Blacker, and Marvin Fox.

\noindent This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and I acknowledge the Australian Commonwealth Governmentâ€™s contribution in relation to the RTP scholarship.
