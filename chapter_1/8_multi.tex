\subsection{Multiwavelength Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{radio, uv, optical}
    \item \textcolor{red}{often these have a different class of objects and are selected in different ways so the luminosity functions looks different}
    \item \textcolor{red}{agn selection papers}
    \item \textcolor{red}{cowley 2018 infared agn tend be here}
    \item \textcolor{red}{agn probed by otherwavelengths have distinguishing feautres, radio older, xray middleaged}
\end{itemize}
